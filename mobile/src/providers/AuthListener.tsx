/**
 * Bridges Firebase's own auth state into the Zustand store the rest of the
 * app reads from. Mounted once, near the root -- everything else just
 * reads useAuthStore()/useAuth() and never touches firebase/auth directly.
 *
 * `status` starts as "loading" and every screen in the app (both the
 * (auth) and (app) root layouts) shows a full-screen spinner for as long
 * as it stays that way -- there was no ceiling on that at all before. If
 * Firebase's very first onAuthStateChanged callback never fires (a broken
 * AsyncStorage-backed persistence init is one realistic way that happens),
 * the whole app was stuck on a spinner with zero way out, and none of the
 * network-timeout work elsewhere ever got a chance to run, because this
 * runs before any of that. If nothing fires within BOOT_TIMEOUT_MS, this
 * forces "unauthenticated" as a safe default -- worst case, a real session
 * shows the login screen once and signing in again works normally.
